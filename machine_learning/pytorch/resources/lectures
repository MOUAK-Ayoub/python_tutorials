Using one mlp taking as input all  the variables  for detecting a pattern will not lead to detect the object if the location changed.
So the need of sliding a window that have the same size as the pattern we are searching for
We use the same weights for all the windows sliding over the image (or any input in general). The weight can be viewed as correlation filter
and represent the feature we are searching for(say a flower).
The convolution, so the filter used, are not interpreted as edge detectors, but a sub(sub)pattern to be matched with.
Distribution of the scanning lead to less parameters in the model.
Max pooling (dawnsampling) is used in these type of MLPs and is viewed as another filter, which have size in the order of 2 with striding.

rethinking  cnn
calculate the recpetive field at the subsequent layers using stride, and with maxpool
testing cnn with more deep layers
Testing cnn with stride as he did
