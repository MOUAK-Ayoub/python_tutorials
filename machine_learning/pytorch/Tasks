Plot accuracy as function of the number of kernels used for convolution
Impact of regularisation on accuracy
Use of batch noramalization and dropout
KNN for CIFAR10 dataset classification
Use wavelets for cnn and fourier transform
Using spring or framework like spring for aop and DI, for autowiring different datasets
optimize the relations between the files
Logging and plotting practices in python
add a dictionary for dataset init  which take batch size and other parameters
Adding dataset validation during training
Determine what is learning show weight as images, and the output of covolution and the type of filters learned for cnn , say
